"""
Welcome to pdf_utils. The purpose of this package is to fix problems
with scanned PDF documents. 

**Note** - pdf_utils contains a module `PDF` which contains a class 
`PDF`. Since pdf_utils.PDF.PDF seemed redundant, this package imports 
the PDF class. The documentation still shows the extra PDF module in the
middle, but just import the class as `pdf_utils.PDF`.
