"""
Welcome to pdf_utils. The purpose of this package is to fix problems
with scanned PDF documents. 

**Note** - pdf_utils contains a module `PDF` which contains a class of
the same name. In order to remove the extra '.PDF' from the module
structure, this package imports the PDF class, so you can import the
PDF class as `pdf_utils.PDF`.
