# PDF Utils
PDF Utilities to make common tasks a bit easier. Currently, it just contains
fixes I need for the documents produced by my one-sided scanner, but I may add
to it as time permits.  

There is only one class: `pdf_utils.PDF`. You can read all about it in the 
documentation folder, which includes usage samples: 
[documentation/pdf_utils/index.html](documentation/pdf_utils/index.html)
